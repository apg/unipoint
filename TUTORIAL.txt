This is a tutorial about unipoint-mode, a simple Emacs minor-mode for adding
unicode characters to your code via their TeX names.

If you're like me, you find some value in using unicode in code, but find it
extremely annoying to do. With unipoint you can just type:

   \lambda C-\ ==> λ

You can also hit C-\ first, type the TeX name and then hit RET

   C-\ alpha RET ==> α

Tab completion works here too.

   C-\ al TAB

In situations where you go the inline approach (e.g. \aleph C-\), there's a
completion mechanism as well.

\sub C-\ should change \sub to \subset. Hitting C-\ again will complete:

   \sub C-\ ==> \subset C-\ ==> ⊂

but type eq after \subset completes:

   \sub C-\ ==> \subset eq C-\ ==> ⊆

Programs that are maths heavy are simple:

   \theta = \theta_0 + \omega_0 * t + (1/2) * \alpha * t^2 ==>
        θ = θ_0 + ω_0 * t + (1/2) * α * t^2
